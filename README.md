# color-contrast

a small experiment around visualizing relative luminance contrast within sRGB colorspace.

<div style="display:flex; justify-content:space-between">
<img src="public/1.png" width="48%" />
<img src="public/2.png" width="48%" />
</div>

the general approach here is an iterative method to determine a lightness value resulting in a relative luminance contrast ratio equalling 4.5 given a hue, a saturation, and an HSL color.

solving this alows us to plot a boundary across hue/lightness space, showing the available values with adequate relative luminance contrast given any color.

spun up from `create-react-app`, so â€”

- clone repo
- npm i
- npm run start

to get this up and running locally.

lots of performance gains to be had in the react render and event handlers.

sorry that this isn't packaged up nicely, but feel free to use the methods in `utils` to do as you please.
